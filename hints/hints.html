<h1>Web Speech API SpeechSynthesis interface: hints demo</h1>

<p>This demo uses the <a href="<a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/speech-api/raw-file/tip/speechapi.html#tts-section">SpeechSynthesis interface</a> of the <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/speech-api/raw-file/tip/speechapi.html#dfn-ttsgetvoices">Web Speech API</a>. Check <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=speech-synthesis">CanIUse.com</a> for current browser support.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>When keyboard or mouse focus is placed on the button, a hint is spoken by the default platform Text To Speech (TTS) voice.</p>

<div id="example">
<button data-hint="Use space or enter to activate">Foo</button>
</div>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>This technique could be used to provide help for people with cognitive disabilities, or people unfamiliar with the web. It would not be needed for simple controls (this is just a demo), but it could be used for complex controls like sliders, tabs etc.</p>

<p>If help was made available in this way, it would need to be made "opt-in". Most people will not want the hints to be spoken.</p>
